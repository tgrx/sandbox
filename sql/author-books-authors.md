## Description

There are two tables: `authors` and `books`, bound as many-to-many via intermediate table `ab`.
Given the author, display its books and for each book display a set of its authors.

### Example

Author A has created books {A, AB, ABC}.

Author B has created books {B, BC, ABC, BCD}.

Author C has created books {C, BC, ABC, BCD}.

Author D has created books {D, BCD}.

For the given author name, i.e. "C", the query MUST return a table:

| book | authors |
|------|---------|
| C    | C       |
| BC   | {B,C}   |
| ABC  | {A,B,C} |
| BCD  | {B,C,D} |

## Dataset

### Tables

Table `authors`:

```sql
create table if not exists authors
(
  author text primary key
);
```

Table `books`:

```sql
create table if not exists books
(
  book text primary key
);
```

<details><summary>Table for mtm bond: (hidden because obvious)</summary>

```sql
create table if not exists ab
(
  book   text not null
         references books(book)
             on update cascade on delete cascade,
  author text not null
         references authors(author)
             on update cascade on delete cascade
);

create index ab_author_idx on ab(author);
create index ab_book_idx on ab(book);
```
</details>

### Data

#### Amounts

| Table   | Rows  |
|:--------|------:|
| authors |    26 |
| books   |  ~18k |
| ab      |  ~68k |
| CROSS   |  ~33b |

#### Authors

Authors are `string.ascii_uppercase` letters from Python stdlib.

<details><summary>Example</summary>

```sql
select * from authors order by random() limit 4;
```

| author |
|--------|
| A |
| S |
| M |
| R |

</details>

#### Books

Books are the union of all combinations of authors of size 1..4.

```python
from itertools import combinations
from string import ascii_uppercase

books = sorted(
    "".join(c)
    for n in range(5)
    for c in combinations(ascii_uppercase, n)
)
```

<details><summary>Example</summary>

```sql
select * from books order by random() limit 4;
```

| book |
|------|
| SAM  |
| A    |
| ASMR |
| RS   |

</details>

#### Many-to-many bond

Supposed to be obvious.

<details><summary>If not...</summary>

Each book contains names of its authors by definition, so mtm table is formed as:

```sql
with books_authors(author, book) as (
    select
        author,
        book
    from
        books,
        unnest(regexp_split_to_array(book, '')) as author
    )
insert
  into
    ab(author, book)
select
    author,
    book
  from
    books_authors
;
```

```sql
select * from ab where book = 'ASMR';
```

| book | author |
|------|--------|
| ASMR | A      |
| ASMR | S      |
| ASMR | M      |
| ASMR | R      |

</details>

## Solutions

### Approach NULL: na√Øve

Na√Øve query with `WHERE author = 'M'`. Does not work.

<details><summary>SQL</summary>

```sql
select
  b.book,
  array_agg(a.author order by a.author) as authors
  from
    authors a,
    books   b,
            ab
  where
    a.author = ab.author and
    ab.book = b.book and
    a.author = 'M'
  group by
    b.book
;
```

</details>

<details><summary>Response sample</summary>

| book | authors |
|------|---------|
| ALM  | {M}     |
| ALMB | {M}     |
| ...  | ...     |

</details>

### Approach 1: "HAVING"

Yep, just filtering of grouped data. 

<details><summary>SQL</summary>

```sql
select
  b.book,
  array_agg(a.author order by a.author) as authors
  from
    authors a,
    books   b,
            ab
  where
    a.author = ab.author and
    ab.book = b.book
  group by
    b.book
  having
    '{"M"}' <@ array_agg(a.author)
```

</details>

<details><summary>Query plan</summary>

‚åõÔ∏è Timing: 256 _¬±51_ ms

‚úÖ Pros: selecting ordered data (eliminated by GroupAggregate)

‚ùå Cons: aggregate filter in `having`

### Approach 2: "GROUP BY" subquery + "WHERE"

Almost the same as [Approach 1](#approach-1-having).
Grouped data is closed under the subquery, and main query performs WHERE filtering.

What one may expect: there is no need to produce the aggregate twice, for both `SELECT` and `HAVING`.

What the reality hits with: try to observe and compare query plans. PostgreSQL is smart indeed.

### Approach 3: "GROUP BY" CTE + "WHERE"

Expecting PostgreSQL to build a table-like object and do not perform filtering by aggregate.

   from
     authors a,
     books   b,
             ab
   where
     a.author = ab.author and
     ab.book = b.book
   group by
     b.book
  )

### Approach 5: CTE + CTE

In this approach we build two CTEs.
The former produces books of given author.
The latter produces authors for books from the former.

This approach may be implemented in two ways:

1. select plain data in CTE 2, apply grouping in the top query;
1. apply grouping in CTE 2, select `*` in the top query;

Both ways are equivalent.

### Approach 6: CTE + CTE on mtm table

In this example (and maybe in your project) the whole information is contained in many-to-many table.
